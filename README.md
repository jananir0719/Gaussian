# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Forward Elimination: Convert the augmented matrix to an upper triangular form by eliminating the entries below the pivot element through row operations
2. artial Pivoting (optional but recommended): To improve numerical stability, swap rows to position the largest absolute pivot element in the current column at the diagonal
3. Back Substitution: Solve for the variables starting from the last row upward using the upper triangular matrix
4. Solution Extraction: Extract the variable values as the solution of the system.

## Program:
